LanguageIdentification

This directory has been created by the GATE bootstrap wizard.
The following files and directories have been created:

LanguageIdentification/
  |
  +-- src/
  |     put all your Java sources in here.
  +-- resources/
  |     any external files used by your plugin (e.g. configuration files,
  |     JAPE grammars, gazetteer lists, etc.) go in here.
  +-- build.xml
  |     Ant build file for building your plugin.
  +-- build.properties
  |     property definitions that control the build process go in here,
  |     in particular, make sure that gate.home points to your copy of GATE.
  +-- creole.xml
        plugin configuration file for GATE - edit this to add parameters, etc.,
        for your resources.

To build your plugin you can use Ant:

ant jar

This will compile the Java code and package the classes into a JAR file.  The
build file also has a target to create JavaDoc documentation - "ant javadoc".
If you run Ant without any arguments it will build everything in one pass.

The build process creates additional files and directories:

LanguageIdentification/
  |
  +-- classes/
  |     compiled classes are placed in here.
  +-- doc/
  |    +-- javadoc/
  +-- LanguageIdentification.jar


Note:
If you do not have your own copy of Ant installed, there is a copy supplied
with GATE which you can use.  Supposing GATE is installed at {gate-home}, you
can use {gate-home}/bin/ant (or {gate-home}\bin\ant on Windows).
